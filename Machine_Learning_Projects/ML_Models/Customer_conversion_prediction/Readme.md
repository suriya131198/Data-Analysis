# Customer Conversion Prediction

### We have historical data of telephonic calls details, and our motive is to build a ML Model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance.

#### Features are,
● age (numeric) <br>
● job : type of job <br>
● marital : marital status <br>
● educational_qual : education status <br>
● call_type : contact communication type <br>
● day: last contact day of the month (numeric) <br>
● mon: last contact month of year <br>
● dur: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric) <br>
● num_calls: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client <br>
● prev_outcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical:"unknown","other","failure","success") <br>
#### Output variable (desired target):
● y - has the client subscribed to the insurance?
